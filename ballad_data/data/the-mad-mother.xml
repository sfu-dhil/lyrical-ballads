          <l>But nay, my heart is far too glad ;</l>
          <l>And I am happy when I sing</l>
          <l>Full many a sad and doleful thing :</l>
          <l>Then, lovely baby, do not fear!</l>
          <l>I pray thee have no fear of me,</l>
          <l>But, safe as in a cradle, here</l>
          <l>My lovely baby ! thou shalt be,</l>

          <l>A fire was once within my brain ;</l>
          <l>And in my head a dull, dull pain ;</l>
          <l>And fiendish faces one, two, three,</l>
          <l>Hung at my breasts, and pulled at me.</l>
          <l>But then there came a sight of joy ;</l>
          <l>It came at once to do me good ;</l>
          <l>I waked, and saw my little boy,</l>
          <l>My little boy of flesh and blood ;</l>
          <l>Oh joy for me that wight to see !</l>
          <l>For he was here, and only he.</l>

          <l>It cools my blooks ; it cools my brain ;</l>
          <l>Thy lips I feel them, baby ! they</l>
          <l>Draw from my heart the pain away.</l>
          <l>Oh ! press me with thy little hand ;</l>
          <l>It loosens something at my chest ;</l>
          <l>About that tight and deadly band</l>
          <l>I feel thy little fingers press'd.</l>
          <l>The breeze I see is in the tree ;</l>
          <l>It comes to cool my babe and me.</l>

          <l>The high crag cannot work me harm,</l>

          <l>Through hollow snows and rivers wide.</l>
