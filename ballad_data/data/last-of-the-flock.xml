                <l>In distant countries I have been,</l>
                <l>And yet I have not often seen</l>
                <l>A healthy man, a man full grown,</l>
                <l>Weep in the public roads alone.</l>
                <l>But such a one, on English ground,</l>
                <l>And in the broad high-way, 1 met;</l>
                <l>Along the broad high-way he came,</l>
                <l>His cheeks with tears were wet.</l>
                <l>Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad;</l>
                <l>And in his arms a lamb he had.</l>

                <l>He saw me, and he turned aside,</l>
                <l>As if he wished himself to hide :</l>
                <l>Then with his coat he made essay</l>
                <l>To wipe those briny tears away.</l>
                <l>I follow’d him, and said, “ My friend</l>
                <l>“ What ails you ? wherefore weep you so ?”</l>
                <l>—“ Shame on me, Sir! this lusty lamb,</l>
                <l>He makes my tears to flow.</l>
                <l>To-day I fetched him from the rock;</l>

                <l>As healthy sheep as you might see,</l>
                <l>And then I married, and was rich</l>
                <l>As I could wish to be;</l>
                <l>Of sheep I number’d a full score,</l>
