        <p>It is the honourable characteristic of Poetry that its materials are to be found
                    in every subject which can interest the human mind. The evidence of this fact is
                    to be sought, not in the writings of Critics, but in those of Poets themselves. </p>
        <p>The majority of the following poems are to be considered as experiments. They
                    were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of
                    conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the
                    purposes of poetic pleasure. Readers accustomed to the</p>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_010.png" n="ii."/>
        <p>gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers, if they persist in
                    reading this book to its conclusion, will perhaps frequently have to struggle
                    with feelings of strangeness and aukwardness : they will look round for poetry,
                    and will be induced to enquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be
                    permitted to assume that title. It is desirable that such readers, for their own
                    sakes, should not suffer the solitary word Poetry, a word of very disputed
                    meaning, to stand in the way of their gratification ; but that, while they are
                    perusing this book, they should ask themselves if it contains a natural
                    delineation of human passions, human characters, and human incidents; and if the
                    answer be favorable to the author’s wishes, that they should consent to be
                    pleased in spite of that most dreadful enemy to our pleasures, our own
                    pre-established codes of decision.</p>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_011.png" n="iii."/>
        <p>Readers of superior judgment may disapprove of the style in which many of these
                    pieces are executed it must be expected that many lines and phrases will not
                    exactly suit their taste. It will perhaps appear to them, that wishing to avoid
                    the prevalent fault of the day, the author has sometimes descended too low, and
                    that many of his expressions are too familiar, and not of sufficient dignity. It
                    is apprehended, that the more conversant the reader is with our elder writers,
                    and with those in modern times who have been the most successful in painting
                    manners and passions, the fewer complaints of this kind will he have to
                    make.</p>
        <p>An accurate taste in poetry, and in all the other arts, Sir Joshua Reynolds has
                    observed, is an acquired talent, which can only be produced by severe thought,
                    and a long continued intercourse with the best models of composition. This
                    is</p>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_012.png" n="iv."/>
        <p>mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced
                    reader from judging for himself; but merely to temper the rashness of decision,
                    and to suggest that if poetry be a subject on which much time has not been
                    bestowed, the judgment may be erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily
                    will be so.</p>
        <p>The tale of Goody Blake and Harry Gill is founded on a well-authenticated fact
                    which happened in Warwickshire. Of the other poems in the collection, it may be
                    proper to say that they are either absolute inventions of the author, or facts
                    which took place within his personal observation or that of his friends. The
                    poem of the Thorn, as the reader will soon discover, is not supposed to be
                    spoken in the author’s own person : the character of the loquacious narrator
                    will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the storv. The Rime of the
                    Ancyent Marinere was profes-</p>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_013.png" n="v."/>
        <p>sedly written in imitation of the style, as well as of the spirit of the elder
                    poets ; but with a few exceptions, the Author believes that the language adopted
                    in it has been equally intelligible for these three last centuries. The lines
                    entitled Expostulation and Reply, and those which follow, arose out of
                    conversation with a friend who was somewhat unreasonably attached to modern
                    books of moral philosophy.</p>
