                    journey with his companions ; he is left behind, covered over with Deer-skins,
                    and is supplied with water, food, and fuel if the situation of the place will
                    afford it. He is informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue,
                    and if he is unable to follow, or overtake them, he perishes alone in the Desart
                    ; unless he should have the good fortune to fall in with some other Tribes of
                    Indians. It is unnecessary to add that the females are equally, or still more,
                    exposed to the same fate. See that very interesting work, </p>
