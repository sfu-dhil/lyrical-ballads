                <l>In the sweet shire of Cardigan,</l>
                <l>Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall,</l>
                <l>An old man dwells, a little man,</l>
                <l>I’ve heard he once was tall.</l>
                <l>Of years he as upon his back,</l>
                <l>No doubt, a burthen weighty ;</l>
                <l>He says he is three score and ten,</l>
                <l>But others say he’s eighty.</l>

                <l>A long blue livery-coat has he,</l>
                <l>That’s fair behind, and fair before ;</l>
                <l>Yet, meet him where you will, you see</l>
                <l>At once that he is poor.</l>
                <l>Full five and twenty years he lived</l>
                <l>A running huntsman merry ;</l>
                <l>And, though he has but one eye left,</l>
                <l>His cheek is like a cherry.</l>

                <l>No man like him the horn could sound,</l>

                <l>To say the least, four counties round</l>
                <l>Had heard of Simon Lee ;</l>
                <l>His master’s dead, and no one now</l>
                <l>Dwells in the hall of Ivor ;</l>
                <l>Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead ;</l>
                <l>He is the sole survivor.</l>

                <l>His hunting feats have him bereft</l>
                <l>Of his right eye, as you may see:</l>
                <l>And then, what limbs those feats have left</l>
                <l>To poor old Simon Lee !</l>
                <l>He has no son, he has no child,</l>
                <l>His wife, an aged woman,</l>
                <l>Lives with him, near the waterfall,</l>

                <l>His ancles they are swoln and thick ;</l>
                <l>His legs are thin and dry.</l>
                <l>When he was young he little knew</l>
                <l>Of husbandry or tillage ;</l>
                <l>And now he’s forced to work, though weak,</l>
                <l>—The weakest in the village.</l>

                <l>He all the country could outrun,</l>

                <l>And often, ere the race was done,</l>
                <l>He reeled and was stone-blind.</l>
                <l>And still there’s something in the world</l>
                <l>At which his heart rejoices;</l>
                <l>For when the chiming hounds are out,</l>

                <l>Is stouter of the two.</l>
                <l>And though you with your utmost skill</l>
                <l>From labour could not wean them,</l>
                <l>Alas ! ’tis very little, all</l>

                <l>A scrap of land they have, but they</l>
                <l>Are poorest of the poor.</l>
                <l>This scrap of land he from the heath</l>
                <l>Enclosed when he was stronger ;</l>

                <l>My gentle reader, I perceive</l>
                <l>How patiently you’ve waited,</l>
                <l>And I’m afraid that you expect</l>

                <l>O reader ! had you in your mind</l>

                <l>O gentle reader ! you would find</l>
                <l>A tale in every thing.</l>
                <l>What more I have to say is short,</l>
                <l>I hope you'll kindly take it ;</l>
                <l>It is no tale ; but should you think,</l>

                <l>About the root of an old tree,</l>
                <l>A stump of rotten wood.</l>
                <l>The mattock totter’d in his hand ;</l>
                <l>So vain was his endeavour</l>

                <l>Received my proffer’d aid.</l>
                <l>I struck, and with a single blow</l>
                <l>The tangled root I sever’d,</l>
                <l>At which the poor old man so long</l>

                <l>The tears into his eyes were brought,</l>

                <l>They never would have done.</l>
                <l>—I’ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds</l>

                <l>Alas ! the gratitude of men</l>
                <l>Has oftner left me mourning.</l>
