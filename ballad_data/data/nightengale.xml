                <l>But hear no murmuring : it flows silently</l>
                <l>O’er its soft bed of verdure. All is still,</l>
                <l>A balmy night ! and tho’ the stars be dim,</l>

                <l>That gladden the green earth, and we shall find</l>

                <l>A pleasure in the dimness of the stars.</l>

                <l>A melancholy Bird ? O idle thought!</l>
                <l>In nature there is nothing melancholy.</l>
                <l>
                    —But some night-wandering Man, whose heart was pierc’d
                </l>
                <l>With the remembrance of a grievous wrong,</l>
                <l>Or slow distemper or neglected love,</l>
                <l>
                    (And so, poor Wretch ! fill'd all things with himself
                </l>
                <l>And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale</l>
                <l>Of his own sorrows) he and such as he</l>
                <l>First nam’d these notes a melancholy strain ;</l>
                <l>And many a poet echoes the conceit,</l>

                    * “
                    <hi rend="italic">Most musical, most melancholy.</hi>
                    ” This passage in Milton possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere description: it is spoken in the character of the melancholy Man, and has therefore a
                    <hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi>
                    propriety. The Author makes this remark, to rescue himself from the charge of having alluded with levity to a line in Milton: a charge than which none could be more painful him, except perhaps that of having ridiculed his Bible.

                <l>Poet, who hath been building up the rhyme</l>
                <l>When he had better far have stretch’d his limbs</l>
                <l>Beside a brook in mossy forest-dell</l>
                <l>By sun or moonlight, to the influxes</l>
                <l>Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements</l>
                <l>Surrendering his whole spirit, of his song</l>
                <l>And of his fame forgetful ! so his fame</l>
                <l>Should share in nature’s immortality,</l>
                <l>A venerable thing ! and so his song</l>
                <l>Should make all nature lovelier, and itself</l>
                <l>Be lov’d, like nature ! —But ’twill not be so;</l>
                <l>And youths and maidens most poetical</l>
                <l>Who lose the deep’ning twilights of the spring</l>
                <l>In ball-rooms and hot theatres, they still</l>
                <l>Full of meek sympathy must heave their sighs</l>
                <l>O’er Philomela’s pity-pleading strains.</l>
                <l>My Friend, and my Friend’s Sister! we have learnt</l>
                <l>A different lore : we may not thus profane</l>
                <l>Nature’s sweet voices always full of love</l>
                <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_082.png" n="66"/>
                <l>And joyance ! ’Tis the merry Nightingale</l>
                <l>That crowds, and hurries, and precipitates</l>
                <l>With fast thick warble his delicious notes,</l>
                <l>As he were fearful, that an April night</l>
                <l>Would be too short for him to utter forth</l>
                <l>His love-chant, and disburthen his full soul</l>
                <l>Of all its music ! And I know a grove</l>
                <l>Of large extent, hard by a castle huge</l>
                <l>Which the great lord inhabits not: and so</l>
                <l>This grove is wild with tangling underwood,</l>
                <l>And the trim walks are broken up, and grass,</l>
                <l>Thin grass and king-cups grow within the paths.</l>
                <l>But never elsewhere in one place I knew</l>
                <l>So many Nightingales : and far and near</l>
                <l>In wood and thicket over the wide grove</l>
                <l>They answer and provoke each other’s songs—</l>
                <l>With skirmish and capricious passagings,</l>
                <l>And murmurs musical and swift jug jug</l>
                <l>And one low piping sound more sweet than all—</l>
                <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_083.png" n="67"/>
                <l>Stirring the air with such an harmony,</l>
                <l>That should you close your eyes, you might almost</l>
                <l>Forget it was not day ! On moonlight bushes,</l>
                <l>Whose dewy leafits are but half disclos’d,</l>
                <l>You may perchance behold them on the twigs,</l>
                <l>
                    Their bright, bright eyes, their eyes both bright and full,
                </l>
                <l>Glistning, while many a glow-worm in the shade</l>
                <l>Lights up her love-torch,</l>

                <l>With one sensation, and those wakeful Birds</l>
                <l>Have all burst forth in choral minstrelsy,</l>
                <l>As if one quick and sudden Gale had swept</l>

                <l>On blosmy twig still swinging from the breeze,</l>
                <l>And to that motion tune his wanton song,</l>

                <l>We have been loitering long and pleasantly,</l>

                <l>How he would place his hand beside his ear,</l>
                <l>His little hand, the small,forefinger up,</l>
                <l>And bid us listen! And I deem it wise</l>
                <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_085.png" n="69"/>
                <l>To make him Nature's playmate. He knows well</l>
                <l>The evening star: and once when he awoke</l>
                <l>In most distressful mood (some inward pain</l>
                <l>Had made up that strange thing, an infant’s dream)</l>
                <l>I hurried with him to our orchard plot,</l>
                <l>And he beholds the moon, and hush’d at once</l>
                <l>Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,</l>
                <l>While his fair eyes that swam with undropt tears</l>
                <l>Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well—</l>
                <l>It is a father’s tale. But if that Heaven</l>
                <l>Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up</l>
                <l>Familiar with these songs, that with the night</l>
                <l>He may associate Joy ! Once more farewell,</l>
                <l>Sweet Nightingale! once more, my friends! farewell</l>
