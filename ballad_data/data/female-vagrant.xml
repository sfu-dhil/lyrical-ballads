          <l>By Derwent’s side my Father’s cottage stood,</l>
          <l>(The Woman thus her artless story told)</l>
          <l> One field, a flock, and what the neighbouring flood</l>
          <l>Supplied, to him were more than mines of gold.</l>
          <l>Light was my sleep ; my days in transport roll’d :</l>
          <l>With thoughtless joy I stretch’d along the shore</l>
          <l>My father’s nets, or watched, when from the fold</l>
          <l>High o’er the cliffs I led my fleecy store,</l>
          <l>A dizzy depth below ! his boat and twinkling oar.</l>

          <l>An honest man by honest parents bred,</l>

          <l>To lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,</l>
          <l>And in his hearing there my prayers I said :</l>
          <l>And afterwards, by my good father taught,</l>
          <l>I read, and loved the books in which I read ;</l>

          <l>The sabbath bells, and their delightful chime ;</l>
          <l>The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time ;</l>

          <l>There was a youth whom I had loved so long,</l>

          <l>‘Mid the green mountains many and many a song</l>

          <l>Four years each day with daily bread was blest,</l>
          <l>By constant toil and constant prayer supplied.</l>

            <l>Ravage was made, for which no knell was heard.</l>

            <l>Of potters wandering on from door to door :</l>
            <l>But life of happier sort to me portrayed,</l>
            <l>And other joys my fancy to allure ;</l>
            <l>The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor</l>
            <l>In barn uplighted, and companion boon</l>
            <l>Well met from far with revelry secure,</l>
            <l>In depth of forest glade, when jocund June</l>
            <l>Rolled fast along the sky his warn and genial moon.</l>

            <l>To charm the surly house-dog’s faithful bark,</l>
            <l>Or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch ;</l>
            <l>The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match,</l>
            <l>The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill,</l>
            <l>And ear still busy on its nightly watch,</l>
            <l>Were not for me, brought in nothing ill ;</l>
            <l>Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still.</l>
