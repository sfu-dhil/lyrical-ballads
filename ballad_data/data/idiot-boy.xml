          <l>'Tis eight o'clock, –– a clear March night,</l>
          <l>The moon is up–– the sky is blue,</l>
          <l>he owlet in the moonlight air,</l>
          <l>He shouts from nobody knows where; </l>
          <l>He lengthens out his lonely shout, </l>
          <l>Halloo! halloo! a long halloo! </l>

          <l>––Why bustle thus about your door,</l>
          <l>What means this bustle, Betty Foy? </l>
          <l>Why are you in this mighty fret?</l>
          <l>And why on horseback have you set</l>
          <l>Him whom you love, your idiot boy?</l>

          <l>Beneath the moon that shines so bright, </l>
          <l>Till she is tired, let Betty Foy </l>
          <l>With girt and stirrup fiddle-faddle;</l>
          <l>But wherefore set upon a saddle </l>
          <l>Him whom she loves, her idiot boy?</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>There’s scarce a soul that's out of bed;</l>
          <l>Good Betty! put him down again;</l>
          <l>His lips with joy they burr at you,</l>
          <l>But, Betty! what has he to do </l>
          <l>With stirrup, saddle, or with rein?</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>The world will say ’tis very idle,</l>
          <l>Bethink you of the time of night; </l>
          <l>There’s not a mother, no not one,</l>
          <l>But when she hears what you have done, </l>
          <l>Oh! Betty she’ll be in a fright.</l>

          <l>But Betty's bent on her intent,</l>
          <l>For her good neighbour, Susan Gale, </l>
          <l>Old Susan, she who dwells alone,</l>
          <l>Is sick, and makes a piteous moan,</l>
          <l>As if her very life would fail.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>There’s not a house within a mile,</l>
          <l>No hand to help them in distress:</l>
          <l>Old Susan lies a bed in pain,</l>
          <l>And sorely puzzled are the twain,</l>
          <l>For what she ails they cannot guess.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty’s husband’s at the wood, </l>
          <l>Where by the week he doth abide,</l>
          <l>A woodman in the distant vale;</l>
          <l>There’s none to help poor Susan Gale, </l>
          <l> What must be done? what will betide?</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_170.png" n="152"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty from the lane has fetched </l>
          <l>Her pony, that is mild and good, </l>
          <l>Whether he be in joy or pain, </l>
          <l>Feeding at will along the lane,</l>
          <l>Or bringing faggots from the wood.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And he is all in travelling trim,</l>
          <l>And by the moonlight, Betty Foy </l>
          <l>Has up upon the saddle set,</l>
          <l>The like was never heard of yet,</l>
          <l>Him whom she loves, her idiot boy.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And he must post without delay </l>
          <l>Across the bridge that’s in the dale, </l>
          <l>And by the church, and o’er the down, </l>
          <l>To bring a doctor from the town,</l>
          <l>Or she will die, old Susan Gale.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_171.png" n="153"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>There is no need of boot or spur,</l>
          <l>There is no need of whip or wand,</l>
          <l>For Johnny has his holly-bough,</l>
          <l>And with a hurly-burly now </l>
          <l>He shakes the green bough in his hand.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty o’er and o’er has told </l>
          <l>The boy who is her best delight,</l>
          <l>Both what to follow, what to shun,</l>
          <l>What do, and what to leave undone,</l>
          <l>How turn to left, and how to right.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty’s most especial charge,</l>
          <l>Was, “ Johnny! Johnny! mind that you </l>
          <l>“Come home again, nor stop at all, </l>
          <l>“Come home again, whate’er befal,</l>
          <l> “My Johnny do, I pray you do." </l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_172.png" n="154"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>To this did Johnny answer make,</l>
          <l>Both with his head, and with his hand, </l>
          <l>And proudly shook the bridle too,</l>
          <l>And then! his words were not a few, </l>
          <l>Which Betty well could understand.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And now that Johnny is just going, </l>
          <l>Though Betty’s in a mighty flurry,</l>
          <l>She gently pats the pony’s side,</l>
          <l>On which her idiot boy must ride,</l>
          <l>And seems no longer in a hurry.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>But when the pony moved his legs,</l>
          <l>Oh! then for the poor idiot boy!</l>
          <l>For joy he cannot hold the bridle,</l>
          <l>For joy his head and heels are idle,</l>
          <l> He’s idle all for very joy.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_173.png" n="155"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And while the pony moves his legs,</l>
          <l>In Johnny’s left-hand you may see,</l>
          <l>The green bough’s motionless and dead;</l>
          <l>The moon that shines above his head </l>
          <l>Is not more still and mute than he.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>His heart it was so full of glee,</l>
          <l>That till full fifty yards were gone,</l>
          <l>He quite forgot his holly whip,</l>
          <l>And all his skill in horsemanship,</l>
          <l>Oh! happy, happy, happy John.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty’s standing at the door,</l>
          <l>And Betty’s face with joy o’erflows, </l>
          <l>Proud of herself, and proud of him, </l>
          <l>She sees him in his travelling trim; </l>
          <l>How quietly her Johnny goes.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_174.png" n="156"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>The silence of her idiot boy,</l>
          <l>What hopes it sends to Betty's heart! </l>
          <l>He’s at the guide-post— he turns right, </l>
          <l>She watches till he’s out of sight,</l>
          <l>And Betty will not then depart.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>Burr, burr—– now Johnny's lips they burr, </l>
          <l>As loud as any mill, or near it,</l>
          <l>Meek as a lamb the pony moves,</l>
          <l>And Johnny makes the noise he loves, </l>
          <l>And Betty listens, glad to hear it.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>Away she hies to Susan Gale:</l>
          <l>And Johnny’s in a merry tune,</l>
          <l>The owlets hoot, the owlets curr,</l>
          <l>And Johnny’s lips they burr, burr, burr, </l>
          <l>And on he goes beneath the moon.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_175.png" n="157"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>His steed and he right well agree,</l>
          <l>For of this pony there’s a rumour,</l>
          <l>That should he lose his eyes and ears,</l>
          <l>And should he live a thousand years,</l>
          <l>He never will be out of humour.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>But then he is a horse that thinks!</l>
          <l>And when he thinks his pace is slack; </l>
          <l>Now, though he knows poor Johnny well, </l>
          <l>Yet for his life he cannot tell.</l>
          <l>What he has got upon his back.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>So through the moonlight lanes they go, </l>
          <l>And far into the moonlight dale,</l>
          <l>And by the church, and o’er the down, </l>
          <l>To bring a doctor from the town,</l>
          <l>To comfort poor old Susan Gale.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_176.png" n="158"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty, now at Susan’s side,</l>
          <l>Is in the middle of her story,</l>
          <l>What comfort Johnny soon will bring, </l>
          <l>With many a most diverting thing,</l>
          <l>Of Johnny’s wit and Johnny’s glory.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty’s still at Susan’s side:</l>
          <l>By this time she’s not quite so flurried; </l>
          <l>Demure with porringer and plate </l>
          <l>She sits, as if in Susan’s fate </l>
          <l>Her life and soul were buried.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>But Betty, poor good woman! she,</l>
          <l>You plainly in her face may read it, </l>
          <l>Could lend out of that moment's store </l>
          <l>Five years of happiness or more,</l>
          <l>To any that might need it.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_177.png" n="159"/>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>But yet I guess that now and then </l>
          <l>With Betty all was not so well,</l>
          <l>And to the road she turns her ears,</l>
          <l>And thence full many a sound she hears,</l>
          <l>Which she to Susan will not tell.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,</l>
          <l>“As sure as there’s a moon in heaven," </l>

          <l>"They’ll both be here, ’tis almost ten,</l>

          <l>And Susan has a dreadful night.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty, half an hour ago,</l>
          <l>On Johnny vile reflections cast;</l>
          <l>“A little idle sauntering thing!" </l>
          <l>With other names, an endless string, </l>
          <l>But now that time is gone and past.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Betty’s drooping at the heart, </l>
          <l>That happy time all past and gone,</l>

          <l>"The doctor he has made him wait,</l>

          <l>And Susan’s growing worse and worse,</l>

          <l>If she must go or she must stay:</l>

          <l>There’s neither horse nor man abroad, </l>

        </lg>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>And Susan she begins to fear </l>
          <l>Of sad mischances not a few,</l>
          <l>That Johnny may perhaps be drown’d, </l>
          <l>Or lost perhaps, and never found; </l>
          <l>Which they must both for ever rue.</l>

        <lg type="stanza">
          <l>She prefaced half a hint of this </l>
          <l>With, “God forbid it should be true!"</l>
          <l>At the first word that Susan said</l>
          <l>Cried Betty, rising from the bed,</l>
          <l>“Susan, I’d gladly stay with you.</l>

          <l>And all that to herself she talked, </l>
