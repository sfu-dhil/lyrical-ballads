        <l>—Nay, Traveller! rest. This lonely yew-tree stands </l>
        <l>Far from all human dwelling : what if here </l>
        <l>No sparkling rivulet spread the verdant herb;</l>
        <l>What if these barren boughs the bee not loves ;</l>
        <l>Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves, </l>
        <l>That break against the shore, shall lull thy mind </l>
        <l>By one soft impulse saved from vacancy.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
        <l>————————Who he was</l>
        <l>That piled these stones, and with the mossy sod</l>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_076.png" n="60"/>
        <l>First covered o’er, and taught this aged tree,</l>
        <l>Now wild, to bend its arms in circling shade,</l>
        <l>I well remember.—He was one who own’d </l>
        <l>No common soul. In youth, by genius nurs’d, </l>
        <l>And big with lofty views, he to the world </l>
        <l>Went forth, pure in his heart, against the taint </l>
        <l>Of dissolute tongues, ’gainst jealousy, and hate, </l>
        <l>And scorn, against all enemies prepared,</l>
        <l>All but neglect: and so, his spirit damped </l>
        <l>At once, with rash disdain he turned away,</l>
        <l>And with the food of pride sustained his soul </l>
        <l>In solitude.—Stranger ! these gloomy boughs </l>
        <l>Had charms for him ; and here he loved to sit,</l>
        <l>His only visitants a straggling sheep,</l>
        <l>The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper ; </l>
        <l>And on these barren rocks, with juniper,</l>
        <l>And heath, and thistle, thinly sprinkled o’er, </l>
        <l>Fixing his downward eye, he many an hour </l>
        <l>A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here </l>
        <l>An emblem of his own unfruitful life :</l>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_077.png" n="61"/>
        <l>And lifting up his head, he then would gaze </l>
        <l>On the more distant scene ; how lovely ’tis </l>
        <l>Thou seest, and he would gaze till it became </l>
        <l>Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain </l>
        <l>The beauty still more beauteous. Nor, that time, </l>
        <l>Would he forget those beings, to whose minds,</l>
        <l>Warm from the labours of benevolence,</l>
        <l>The world, and man himself, appeared a scene </l>
        <l>Of kindred loveliness : then he would sigh</l>
        <l>With mournful joy, to think that others felt </l>
        <l>What he must never feel : and so, lost man !</l>
        <l>On visionary views would fancy feed,</l>
        <l>Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale</l>
        <l>He died, this seat his only monument.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg type="stanza">
        <l>If thou be one whose heart the holy forms</l>
        <l>Of young imagination have kept pure,</l>
        <l>Stranger! henceforth be warned ; and know, that pride, </l>
        <l>Howe’er disguised in its own majesty,</l>
        <l>Is littleness ; that he, who feels contempt</l>
        <pb facs="Wordsworth_1798_078.png" n="62"/>
        <l>For any living thing, hath faculties </l>
        <l>Which he has never used ; that thought with him </l>
        <l>Is in its infancy. The man, whose eye </l>
        <l>Is ever on himself, doth look on one,</l>
        <l>The least of nature’s works, one who might move </l>
        <l>The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds </l>
        <l>Unlawful, ever. O, be wiser thou !</l>
        <l>Instructed that true knowledge leads to love,</l>
        <l>True dignity abides with him alone </l>
        <l>Who, in the silent hour of inward thought,</l>
        <l>Can still suspect, and still revere himself,</l>
        <l>In lowliness of heart.</l>
