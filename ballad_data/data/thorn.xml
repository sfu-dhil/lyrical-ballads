                    <l>In truth you’d find it hard to say,</l>

                    <l>Not higher than a two-years’ child,</l>

                    <l>No leaves it has, no thorny points ;</l>
                    <l>It is a mass of knotted joints,</l>
                    <l>A wretched thing forlorn.</l>
                    <l>It stands erect, and like a stone</l>

                    <l>For many a time and oft were heard</l>
                    <l>Cries coming from the mountain-head,</l>
                    <l>Some plainly living voices were,</l>
                    <l>And others, I’ve heard many swear,</l>
                    <l>Were voices of the dead :</l>
                    <l>I cannot think, whate’er they say.</l>
                    <l>They had to do with Martha Ray.</l>

                    <l>The thorn which I’ve described to you,</l>
                    <l>And there sits in a scarlet cloak,</l>
                    <l>I will be sworn is true.</l>
                    <l>For one day with my telescope,</l>
                    <l>To view the ocean wide and bright,</l>
                    <l>When to this country first I came,</l>
                    <l>Ere I had heard of Martha’s name,</l>
                    <l>I climbed the mountain’s height:</l>
                    <l>A storm came on, and 1 could see</l>
                    <l>No object higher than my knee.</l>

                    <l>No screen, no fence could I discover,</l>
                    <l>And then the wind ! in faith, it was</l>
                    <l>A wind full ten times over.</l>
                    <l>I looked around, I thought I saw</l>

                    <l>A jutting crag, and off I ran,</l>
                    <l>Head-foremost, through the driving rain,</l>
                    <l>The shelter of the crag to gain,</l>
                    <l>And, as 1 am a man,</l>
                    <l>Instead of jutting crag, I found</l>
                    <l>A woman seated on the ground.</l>

                    <l>Her face it was enough for me;</l>
                    <l>I turned about and heard her cry,</l>

                    <l>And there she sits, until the moon</l>
                    <l>Through half the clear blue sky will go.</l>
                    <l>And when the little breezes make</l>
                    <l>The waters of the pond to shake,</l>
                    <l>As all the country know,</l>

                    <l>She hanged her baby on the tree,</l>
                    <l>Some say she drowned it in the pond,</l>

                    <l>With drops of that poor infant’s blood ;</l>

                    <l>Some say, if to the pond you go,</l>
