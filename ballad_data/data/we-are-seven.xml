                    <l>A simple child, dear brother Jim,</l>
                    <l>That lightly draws its breath,</l>
                    <l>And feels its life in every limb,</l>
                    <l>What should it know of death ?</l>

                    <l>I met a little cottage girl,</l>
                    <l>She was eight years old, she said ;</l>
                    <l>Her hair was thick with many a curl</l>
                    <l>That cluster’d round her head.</l>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>She had a rustic, woodland air,</l>
                    <l>And she was wildly clad;</l>
                    <l>Her eyes were fair, and very fair,</l>
                    <l>—Her beauty made me glad.</l>

                    <l>“ How many may you be ?”</l>
                    <l>“ How many ? seven in all,” she said,</l>
                    <l>And wondering looked at me.</l>

                    <l>“ And where are they, I pray you tell ?”</l>
                    <l>She answered, “ Seven are we,</l>

                    <l>“ Dwell near them with my mother.”</l>

                    <l>Then did the little Maid reply,</l>

                    <l>” You run about, my little maid,</l>
                    <l>“ Your limbs they are alive;</l>
                    <l>“ If two are in the church-yard laid,</l>

                    <l>“ Their graves are green, they may be seen,’’</l>
                    <l>The little Maid replied,</l>
                    <l>“ Twelve steps or more from my mother’s door,</l>
                    <l>“ And they are side by side.</l>

                    <l>“ And there upon the ground I sit—</l>
                    <l>“I sit and sing to them.</l>

                    <l>“ And often after sunset, Sir,</l>
                    <l>“ When it is light and fair,</l>
                    <l>“ I take my little porringer,</l>
                    <l>“ And eat my supper there.</l>

                    <l>“ The first that died was little Jane ;</l>
                    <l>“ In bed she moaning lay,</l>
                    <l>“ Till God released her of her pain,</l>
                    <l>“ And then she went away.</l>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>“ So in the church-yard she was laid,</l>
                    <l>“ And all the summer dry,</l>
                    <l>“ Together round her grave we played,</l>
                    <l>“ My brother John and I.</l>

                    <l>“ And when the ground was white with snow,</l>
                    <l>“ And I could run and slide,</l>
                    <l>“ My brother John was forced to go,</l>
                    <l>“ And he lies by her side.”</l>

                    <l>“ How many are you then,’’ said I.</l>
                    <l>“ If they two are in Heaven ?”</l>
                    <l>The little Maiden did reply,</l>
                    <l>“ O Master! we are seven.’’</l>

                    <l>’Twas throwing words away; for still</l>
                    <l>The little Maid would have her will,</l>
                    <l>And said, “ Nay, we are seven !”</l>
