                    <l>Young Harry was a lusty drover,</l>

                    <l>His cheeks were red as ruddy clover,</l>
                    <l>His voice was like the voice of three.</l>
                    <l>Auld Goody Blake was old and poor,</l>
                    <l>Ill fed she was, and thinly clad ;</l>
                    <l>And any man who pass’d her door,</l>
                    <l>Might see how poor a hut she had.</l>

                    <l>All day she spun in her poor dwelling,</l>
                    <l>And then her three hours’ work at night!</l>
                    <l>Alas ! ’twas hardly worth the telling,</l>
                    <l>It would not pay for candle-light.</l>
                    <l>—This woman dwelt in Dorsetshire,</l>
                    <l>Her hut was on a cold hill-side,</l>
                    <l>And in that country coals are dear,</l>
                    <l>For they come far by wind and tide.</l>

                    <l>By the same fire to boil their pottage,</l>
                    <l>Two poor old dames, as I have known,</l>
                    <l>Will often live in one small cottage,</l>
                    <l>But she, poor woman, dwelt alone.</l>
                    <l>’Twas well enough when summer came,</l>
                    <l>The long, warm, lightsome summer-day,</l>
                    <l>Then at her door the canty dame</l>
                    <l>Would sit, as any linnet gay.</l>

                    <l>But when the ice our streams did fetter,</l>
                    <l>Oh ! then how her old bones would shake !</l>
                    <l>You would have said, if you had met her,</l>
                    <l>’Twas a hard time for Goody Blake.</l>
                    <l>Her evenings then were dull and dead ;</l>
                    <l>Sad case it was, as you may think,</l>
                    <l>For very cold to go to bed,</l>
                    <l>And then for cold not sleep a wink.</l>

                    <l>Oh joy for her ! when e’er in winter</l>
                    <l>The winds at night had made a rout,</l>
                    <l>And scatter'd many a lusty splinter.</l>
                    <l>And many a rotten bough about.</l>
                    <l>Yet never had she, well or sick,</l>
                    <l>As every roan who knew her says,</l>
                    <l>A pile before-hand, wood or stick,</l>
                    <l>Enough to warm her for three days.</l>

                    <l>Now, when the frost was past enduring,</l>
                    <l>And made her poor old bones to ache,</l>
                    <l>Could any thing be more alluring,</l>
                    <l>Than an old hedge to Goody Blake ?</l>
                    <l>And now and then, it must be said,</l>
                    <l>When her old bones were cold and chill,</l>
                    <l>She left her fire, or left her bed,</l>
                    <l>To seek the hedge of Harry Gill.</l>

                    <l>And vow’d that she. should be detected,</l>
                    <l>And he on her would vengeance take.</l>
                    <l>And oft from his warm fire he’d go,</l>
                    <l>And to the fields his road would take,</l>
                    <l>And there, at night, in frost and snow,</l>
                    <l>He watch’d to seize old Goody Blake.</l>

                    <l>And once, behind a rick of barley,</l>
                    <l>Thus looking out did Harry stand ;</l>
                    <l>The moon was full and shining clearly,</l>
                    <l>And crisp with frost the stubble-land.</l>
                    <l>—He hears a noise—he’s all awake—</l>
                    <l>Again—on tip-toe down the hill</l>
                    <l>He softly creeps—'Tis Goody Blake,</l>
                    <l>She's at the hedge of Harry Gill.</l>

                    <l>Right glad was he when he beheld her :</l>
                    <l>Stick after stick did Goody pull,</l>
                    <l>He stood behind a bush of elder,</l>
                    <l>Till she had filled her apron full.</l>
                    <l>When with her load she turned about,</l>
                    <l>The bye-road back again to take,</l>
                    <l>He started forward with a shout,</l>
                    <l>And sprang upon poor Goody Blake.</l>

                    <l>And fiercely by the arm he took her,</l>
                    <l>And by the arm he held her fast,</l>
                    <l>And fiercely by the arm he shook her,</l>
                    <l>And cried, “ I’ve caught you then at last!”</l>
                    <l>Then Goody, who had nothing said,</l>
                    <l>Her bundle from her lap let fall ;</l>
                    <l>And kneeling on the sticks, she pray’d</l>
                    <l>To God that is the judge of all.</l>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>She pray’d, her wither’d hand uprearing,</l>

                    <l>“ God ! who art never out of hearing,</l>
                    <l>“ O may he never more be warm !”</l>
                    <l>The cold, cold moon above her head,</l>
                    <l>Thus on her knees did Goody pray,</l>
                    <l>Young Harry heard what she had said,</l>
                    <l>And icy-cold he turned away.</l>

                    <l>He went complaining all the morrow</l>

                    <l>His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow,</l>
                    <l>Alas! that day for Harry Gill !</l>
                    <l>That day he wore a riding-coat,</l>
                    <l>But not a whit the warmer he :</l>
                    <l>Another was on Thursday brought,</l>
                    <l>And ere the Sabbath he had three.</l>

                    <l>Like a loose casement in the wind.</l>
                    <l>And Harry’s flesh it fell away;</l>
                    <l>And all who see him say ’tis plain,</l>
                    <l>That, live as long as live he may,</l>
