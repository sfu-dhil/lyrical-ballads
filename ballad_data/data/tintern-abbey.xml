                    <l>I came among these hills ; when like a roe</l>
                    <l>I bounded o’er the mountains, by the sides</l>
                    <l>Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,</l>
                    <l>Wherever nature led ; more like a man</l>
                    <l>Flying from something that he dreads, than one</l>
                    <l>Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then</l>
                    <l>(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,</l>
                    <l>And their glad animal movements all gone by,)</l>

                    <l>What then I was. The sounding cataract</l>
                    <l>Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,</l>
                    <l>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</l>
                    <l>Their colours and their forms, were then to me</l>
                    <l>An appetite: a feeling and a love,</l>
                    <l>That had no need of a remoter charm,</l>
                    <l>By thought supplied, or any interest</l>

                    <l>Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur: other gifts</l>
                    <l>Have followed, for such loss, I would believe,</l>
                    <l>Abundant recompense. For I have learned</l>
                    <l>To look on nature, not as in the hour</l>
                    <l>Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes</l>
                    <l>The still, sad music of humanity,</l>

                    <l>A presence that disturbs me with the joy</l>
                    <l>Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime</l>
                    <l>Of something far more deeply interfused,</l>
