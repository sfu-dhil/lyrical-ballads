# Ballads Viewer

Islandora viewer that allows easy styling of very highly constrained TEI XML
with very specific output and styling. This isn't meant to be a general viewer,
just one example.

## Requirements

* [Islandora](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora)
* [Islandora XML Solution Pack](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_solution_pack_xml)

## Usage

Enable this module, then select it as a viewer in the XML Solution Pack's admin
settings.

No additional software or libraries need to be installed. And example XSLT is 
included in ballads.xsl which can be set as a collection or object level 
RENDER_STYLESHEET.

loosely based on Mark Jordan's [Islandora Solution Pack](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_solution_pack_xml). Pull requests and
discussion may be more appropriate there.
